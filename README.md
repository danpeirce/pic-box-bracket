# PIC Project Box Mounting Bracket

The purpose of the mounting bracket is to provide a convenient mounting bracket for prototype 
boards and USB to serial boards for projects. 

* The project box intended to be used has mounting holes refabricated in the lid. 
* The bracket will be attached to those holes with #4 sheet metal screws.
* Platforms for printed circuit boards are incorporated into the design of the bracket. 
* Epoxy will be added to the inside edges of the mounting platforms. Once bonded the printed circuit 
boards will add mechanical strength to the bracket.

This image omly shows a reppresention of the model in OpenSCAD. When the 3D protoyype is printed more images will be added.
